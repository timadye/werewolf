# Oxford Werewolf

What exactly is _Werewolf?_ It's a game. It's another one of those [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) experiences. As far as I can tell, Werewolf is the most purposefully complicated psychological thriller role-playing game ever invented. You may have played variations of it, or similar games like Mafia elsewhere, but I assure you the Oxford version is different. The [roles and rules](Werewolf.md) have been developing over at least the past fifty years. There are rumours that this version hatched from a cosmic egg laid by [_Helliconia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helliconia) author [Brian Aldiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Aldiss). I can neither confirm nor deny that. Anyway, it is complicated, but worth it for the feeling of smug self-satisfaction you get when you do well at a difficult game developed by generations of Oxonian geniuses.

The code here is an attempt to capture that experience online, or perhaps to allow face-to-face playing without a human _Fate_ (which anyway is a contradiction in terms). It is implemented in [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor), largely rewritten from [code](https://github.com/timadye/werewolf/tree/1n-werewolf) for [_One Night Ultimate Werewolf_](http://ultimatewerewolf.herokuapp.com) by [Katie Jiang](https://github.com/katiejiang/).

_Oxford Werewolf_ is still a little rough around the edges, but should be basically playable. It relies on the players to detect the end-game (this can be a good role for dead players).

This code is currently running at https://oxford-werewolf.herokuapp.com, though the free service there only allows ~35 minutes of play before restarting the game (looks like a (bug)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62439688/heroku-free-dyno-idling-mid-test-what-killed-it]).
