# Oxford Werewolf

What exactly is Werewolf? It's a game. It's another one of those University of Oxford experiences. As far as I can tell, Werewolf is the most purposefully complicated psychological thriller role-playing game ever invented. You may have played variations of it, or similar games like Mafia elsewhere, but I assure you the Oxford version is different. The [roles and rules](Werewolf.md) have been developing over at least the past fifty years. There are rumours that this version hatched from a cosmic egg laid by __Helliconia__ author Brian Aldiss. I can neither confirm nor deny that. Anyway, it is complicated, but worth it for the feeling of smug self-satisfaction you get when you do well at a difficult game developed by generations of Oxonian geniuses.

The code here is an attempt to capture that experience online, or perhaps to allow face-to-face playing without a human __Fate__ (which anyway is a contradiction in terms). It is implemented in [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor), based on code for [__One Night Ultimate Werewolf__](https://github.com/katiejiang/1n-werewolf) by [Katie Jiang](https://github.com/katiejiang/), which can be run from [http://ultimatewerewolf.herokuapp.com](http://ultimatewerewolf.herokuapp.com).
